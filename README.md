# twitter_sentiment_analysis

##Overview

This is the code for the Twitter Sentiment Analyzer challenge https://github.com/llSourcell/twitter_sentiment_challenge

##Dependencies

    tweepy (http://www.tweepy.org/)
    textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

Install missing dependencies using pip

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via

python twitter_sentiment_analysis.py

##Challenge

Instead of printing out each tweet, save each Tweet to a CSV file with an associated label. The label should be either 'Positive' or 'Negative'. You can define the sentiment polarity threshold yourself, whatever you think constitutes a tweet being positive/negative. Push your code repository to github then post it in the comments. I'll give the winner a shoutout a week from now!
